I decided on separating the files based on Peer, Client, and Bootstrap because a lot of the methods were getting confusing
to read and discern. I left the main file for sending data because that was same for all of them. I used a map for representing the
object files because that is how the files were set up. The bootstrap server calculates the peers' predecessor and successor
and then informs their predecessor and successors. It also facilitates the sending of requests.
